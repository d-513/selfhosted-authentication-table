# selfhosted-authentication-table
List of SelfHosted apps, with information about their support for OpenID / SAML / LDAP / Proxy Auth

✔️ - Supported - all functionality works including mobile apps (if any)  
😔 - Supported, but breaks some features, mobile apps, users have to still be added manually or not maintained  
❌ - Unsupported  
❔ - Not known yet, to be added  

Proxy Auth theoretically works on all of them, but it will break functionality, display double logins etc.   
So only those explicitly working great with it will be marked as such. Otherwise it will be unsupported.
